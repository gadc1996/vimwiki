= NULL =
Null values represent an empty value (not zero), this can be use to create
a new field without inserting a value on it, or when a field is created,
default value will be NULL.

NULL cannot be tested using logical operators, so special IS NULL and 
IS NOT NULL operators are provided.

`SELECT * FROM costumers WHERE address IS NULL`
`SELECT * FROM costumers WHERE email IS NOT NULL`
