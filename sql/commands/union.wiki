= UNION =
The union operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more select
comands.
`SELECT field FROM table1 UNION SELECT field FROM table2`

For the union command to work:
	- Each SELECT command must have the same number of fields
	- The fields must have similar data type
	- The fields must be in the same order

By default UNION will ignore duplicate values, to show all values including
duplicates use `UNION ALL`
