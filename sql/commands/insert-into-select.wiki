= INSERT INTO SELECT =
The INSERT INTO SELECT command copies data from one table into another table.
The data that is copied do not affect the data that is already on the table,
to paste data into a new table use [[select-into|SELECT INTO]]

Note: for INSERT INTO SELECT to works, data types from both source and target 
table must match

`INSERT INTO table1 SELECT * FROM table2`
