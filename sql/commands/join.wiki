A JOIN clause is used to combine fields from two or more tables, based
on related values between them.
`SELECT orders.ordersID, custmer.costumerName FROM orders INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customerID=customer.customerID`

== Type of JOINS ==

- Left join:: Return all the records from the left table and the matching values on the right table
- right join:: Return all the records from the right table ant the matching values on the left table
