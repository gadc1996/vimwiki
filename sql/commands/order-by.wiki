= ORDER BY =
This keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order,
it will sort in ascending order by default, to sort in descending order use
the DESC keyword after the field that is use for the sorting.

Adding extra fields will sort rows with duplicated values by a second field
For example:
`SELECT * FROM costumers ORDER BY country, city`
If two rows have the same country, they will be sorted then by city

Different fields can have different sorting order, for example:
`SELECT * FROM costumers ORDER BY country DESC, city ASC`

== Syntax ==
`SELECT * FROM costumers ORDER BY country DESC`
`SELECT * FROM costumers ORDER BY country`
