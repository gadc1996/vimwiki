	== ARP ==
	The address resolution protocols is a [[#Communication Protocol|comunication protocol]] used to discover  
	the [[#Link Layer|link]] layer address associated with a given [[#Internet Layer|internet layer]] address
	
	== Communication Protocol ==
	Is a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications system
	to transmit information information
	
	== Internet Layer ==
	Is a group of internetworking methods, protocols and specification in the internet
	protocol suite that are used to transport network packets from the originating host
	across network boundaries
	
	== Link Layer ==
	Is the lowest layer in the internet protocol suite
	
	== Modular ==
	Modular design or modularity is a design principle that subdivides a system into smaller 
	parts called modules, which can be independently created, modified, replated or exchanged
	with other modules or between different systems
	
	== OS ==
	The operating systeme is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources and 
	provides common services for computer programs
	
	== Superuser ==
	The superuser is a special user account used for system administration, it is also known as root,
	administrator, admin or supervisor, depending of the [[glossary#OS|OS]], the user identifier for this user
	is zero in [[glossary#Unix-like|unix-like]] systems, regardless of the name.
	In role base security model, any user with a role of suuperuser is capable of making unrestricted
	potentially advers, system-wide changes.
	
	= Unix =
	FAmily of multitasking, multiuser computer [[Glossary#OS|OS]] that derive from the original
	AT&T Unix.
	Unix systems are characterized by a [[Glosarry#Modular|modular]] design that is usually known as
	the "Unix philosophy", according to this philosophy, the [[Glossary#OS|OS]] should provide:
	
	 1. A set of simple tools, each of which performs a limited, well-defined function
	 2. A unified filesystem
	 3. An inter-process communication mechanism known as pipes
	 4. A shell scripting and command lenguaje
	
	== Unix-like ==
	Is a glossary#OS|OS that behaves in a similar maner to a [[Glossary#Unix|unix]] system, without being certified
	to any [[Glossarry#Unix|unix]] specification
