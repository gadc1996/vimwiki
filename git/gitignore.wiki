= Git Ignore =
Having a `.gitignore` file inside of a project specifies to git a list of files and 
directories that are not going to be tracked.

As well as configurations, there can be a global `.gitignore ` file that will be used
for all projects, and a local `.gitignore` file for the repository, local configurations
outweights global configuration

	 == Configure A Global .gitignore ==
	`git config --global core.excludesfiles ~/.gitignore_global`
	
	There is also possible to have a `.gitignore` inside a directory in a project, this 
	.gitignore rules apply only to the files under the directory
	
	== Glob Patterns ==
	Glob patterns are simplified Regular Expressions that shell use, the basic sintax elements
	of glob patterns are:
		*:: Matches zero or more characters
		[abd]:: Matches any character inside the brackets
		?:: Matches a single character 
		[0-9]:: Matches any character between the range of characters
		a/**/z:: Matches nested directories
